# Radix - Getting Started

This repository is a tutorial for setting up an Azure Active Directory authenticated web-application. It uses branches to separate each stage along the way. Look at the changes that are made at each stage and the commit diffs.

## Authenticated web-server stages

1. [A simple python server](/../../tree/python-server)
1. [Get onto Radix](/../../tree/python-container)
1. [OAuth2 Proxy](/../../tree/auth-proxy)

>This master branch serves as a navigation hub and should not contain project files. In order to host any tutorial projects in any of the stages on Radix, a radixconfig file must be present in this branch or in a separate repository's master.
