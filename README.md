# A simple python server

We start out with a minimally complex python web-server backend, [server.py](/server.py), using [palletsprojects.com-flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) library to handle the http boilerplate. The choice of python is not an important one for this example. It's enough to easily verify that the application works once deployed. This server, as is, will only be reachable from `http://localhost:5000` when run. You can see the changes made step by step to a publicly hosted, SSL enabled and authenticated application during this tutorial.
